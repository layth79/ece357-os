# ece357-os

Code for projects completed in a course on operating systems at Cooper Union.

Project 1: functions similarly to the UNIX command cat.

Project 2: functions similarly to the UNIX command find, with the -ls flag.

Project 3: functions as a simplisitc UNIX shell.

Project 4: test program determining capacity of UNIX pipe, and a program that confirms all real-time signals are processed, whereas only one copy of a traditional signal is processed when the same traditional signal is sent multiple times.

Project 5: program explores concepts about virtual memory using mmap system call.

Project 6: implementation of spinlocks and semaphores used in a simulation of a multithreaded program representing a street game called "shell game".

Project 7: assembly language program that functions similarly to the UNIX command cat and examine its operation using strace.
